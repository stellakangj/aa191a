<p> Hello everyone! My name is Stella and I'm from Orange County. I am a junior studying Applied Linguistics and Digital Humanities. I work at the Arts Library and tutor kids (essay writing and creative writing)/ESL students. My current hobbies include exploring Westwood with friends, playing video games, and listening to music. Some places in Westwood that I visited over spring break were Mashti Malone's, Lazy Daisy, and Egg Tuck.</p>
