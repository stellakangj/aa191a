<p> Hello everyone! My name is Stella and I'm from Orange County. I am a junior studying Applied Linguistics and Digital Humanities. I work at the Arts Library and tutor kids (essay writing and creative writing)/ESL students. My current hobbies include exploring Westwood with friends, playing video games, and listening to music. Some places in Westwood that I visited over spring break were Mashti Malone's, Lazy Daisy, and Egg Tuck.</p>

                I like <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=image+of+frog&oq=image+of+frog&aqs=chrome..69i57j0i512l8j0i10i512.2764j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#imgrc=PgACbtvoPfDbdM">frogs</a>
